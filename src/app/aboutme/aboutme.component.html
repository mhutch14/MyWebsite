          <p>I have recently discovered that I have a huge passion for helping dogs of all shapes and sizes. I really want to adopt my own soon but its been tough as of late with a job that travels everywhere.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Dogs. <span class="text-muted"> My Passion Discovered.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">I recently, as of about two years ago, discovered that I have a passion being around dogs and caring for dogs. Since then I have been volunteering at the League for Animal Welfare. At this point I probably have a little over 200 hours of volunteering time put in. I love it! I get to feed , walk, and play with dogs, and since I have gotten to know the trainer over my time there I occasionally get to help with training also. My goal is to soon get into a job that requires less travel and get a dog of my own. I love all breeds but my favorites are golden retrievers, huskies, and collies.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Sports. <span class="text-muted">The Lifelong Journey.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Since I was young, I have been very interested in sports. I will watch a sport of any kind but I am most interested in basketball, hockey, and soccer. I Intensely follow Xavier basketball and watch every game, although this is a down year, I believe they will turn it around soon. For Hockey I follow the Chicago Blackhawks, I attempt to watch everyone of their games also but seeing as the NHL plays many more games it is not always possible for me to watch. I do not follow anyone specific for soccer I just enjoy to watch the game be played. Sports have been an integral part of my life since I was very young and I do not know what I would do if I didnâ€™t have any to watch or play.</p>

          <p class="lead">Although I did not specifically major in a field that taught me about front end programming, I have become much more interested in that side of the product since being in the industry. Although my current title at work is controls engineer, I mainly work on the software side of our product in SQL and Python. In school I built a website for my professor and did some work on a website in one of the groups I was involved in, since then I have been interested in this type of work. My goal is to get a job in the web development field and I am hoping I can achieve that soon.</p>
